  GitHub: [StratusGrid/terraform-aws-bitbucket-onprem-downloader](https://github.com/StratusGrid/terraform-aws-bitbucket-onprem-downloader)

  This module creates an API Gateway, Lambda, and supporting resources.
  The API GW accepts an incoming webhook from a 3rd-party (on premise) Bitbucket server and triggers the Lambda which requests a ZIP archive of the repository which triggered the webhook, and uploads that ZIP to a provided S3 bucket.
  
  <span style="color:red">NOTE:</span> The resulting archive will be named after the branch being retrieved, and any forward slashes will be replaced with hyphens.
  
  ### Pre-deployment Checklist:
  Navigate into the "lambda" directory and build the requisite modules:
  ```shell
  cd lambda
  npm install
  ```
  
  ## Example usage of the module:
  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/example1.tfnot" }}
  ```
